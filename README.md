# SI507F17_finalProject
# Requirement:
## Part Final Project Milestones

[Here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/SI-507-Fall-2017-Final-Project-XwIGPUCZrTaBNTT75uU4B) are your final project requirements. We'll be updating them with increased clarity (e.g. how many points go with what) over the next week or so.

For your Part 3, you should

* Create a GitHub repository for your final project. You don't need to create a git repository with code on your computer yet -- though eventually you'll need to, and you'll need to "build a bridge" between that git repository and your GitHub repository online.

* In that GitHub repository, online, create milestones and issues to lay out the process of your final project, the way you did in [section](https://github.com/SI507-F17/section-week-5) on a few occasions.

* We'll grade this on whether you tried it, but we'll also offer feedback about whether your final project sounds doable/sounds like it's scoped reasonably/if your plan sounds solid/if we have brief recommendations.
